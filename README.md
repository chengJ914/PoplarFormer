# PoplarFormer
Official implementation of "PoplarFormer: A Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for Ordinal Severity Grading of Poplar Black Spot Disease"

PoplarFormer is a dual-branch hybrid architecture built upon an advanced EVA-02 backbone. It is designed to solve the key challenge of this task: capturing both fine-grained, isolated spots (early-stage) and large, coalesced patches (severe-stage).
